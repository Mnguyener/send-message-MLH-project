# send-message-MLH-project
Sends SMS messages between two verified phone numbers using Python and Twilio!
Twilio's Python documentation (https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python) helped a LOT. 
You can also send SMS messages on Twilio's platform through its console via https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/quickstart/send-sms-and-mms (it uses JS though).
